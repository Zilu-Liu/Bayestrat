Title: Bayesian genetic association tests for single-nucleotide
        polymorphisms accounting for population stratification
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Zilu Liu, Asuman Turkmen, Shili Lin

Description: Bayestrat uses principle components (PCs) to correct for population stratification in genetic association studies for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The current implementation considers continuous and discrete covariates but only continuous outcomes.
